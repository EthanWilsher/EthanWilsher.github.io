## Football Stats Made Easy

***

In this project I hope to be able to simplify the statistics of football players to a point where those who do not follow the sport can statistically say who the best players are and maybe some of the reasons they perform so well.

## 2018/2019 Premier League Teams

These are the teams that participated in the Premier League in the 2018 to 2019 season. The Premier league is the best 
league based in the united kingdom. To make it to the premier league a team must be top 3 in the league in which you are then promoted
to the next league and the 3 lowest teams in the league above then get demoted.

kable(WHW, format = "html" ,caption = "Stats for Football Team Wolverhampton Wanderers",align = "cccccccccccccccc") %>% kable_styling()

```

## Best Forward

A forward is praised by their ability to show up, get goals, and work with those around them to get goals.

```{r}
Forward <- filter(df, rank_in_league_top_attackers != -1) %>% 
  select(c('full_name','goals_overall','assists_overall','position','current_club','age','birthday_gmt', 'rank_in_league_top_attackers', 'appearances_overall' )) 

ForwardClean <- Forward[order(Forward$rank_in_league_top_attackers),]

kable(ForwardClean, format = "html" , caption = "Top league Forwards",align = "cccccccccccccccc") %>% kable_styling()

```


## Best Midfielder

A midfielders job is to make sure that they are an open to passing, assisting people in getting their goals, 
and making sure the ball stays on the attack.

```{r}
Mid <- filter(df, rank_in_league_top_midfielders != -1) %>% 
  select(c('full_name','assists_overall','position','current_club','age','birthday_gmt', 'rank_in_league_top_midfielders', 'appearances_overall' )) 

MidClean <- Mid[order(Mid$rank_in_league_top_midfielders),]

kable(MidClean, format = "html" , caption = "Top league Midfielders",align = "cccccccccccccccc") %>% kable_styling()

```


## Best Defender

A defenders main job is in its name they are the front line between the strikers and the goalie so they must
do all in their power to make sure the ball does not get past them. If they are able to do this they can get a clean sheet
meaning no balls get scored on them.

```{r}
Defend <- filter(df, rank_in_league_top_defenders != -1) %>% 
  select(c('full_name','clean_sheets_overall','position','current_club','age','birthday_gmt', 'rank_in_league_top_defenders', 'appearances_overall' )) 

DefendClean <- Defend[order(Defend$rank_in_league_top_defenders),]

kable(DefendClean, format = "html" , caption = "Top league Defenders",align = "cccccccccccccccc") %>% kable_styling()

```

## Best Scorer

A Scorer can be anyone as long as they shoot their shot and get it in they rank. These rankings in this section specifically focus on 
who is the best in their respective club (team).

```{r}

Scorer <- filter(df, rank_in_club_top_scorer != -1) %>% 
  select(c('full_name','goals_overall','assists_overall','position','current_club','age','birthday_gmt', 'rank_in_club_top_scorer', 'appearances_overall' )) 

ScorerClean <- Scorer[order(Scorer$rank_in_club_top_scorer,-Scorer$goals_overall),]

kable(ScorerClean, format = "html" , caption = "Top league Scorer",align = "cccccccccccccccc") %>% kable_styling()


```  


## Best Goalie

A Goalie much like the defender is the last line of defence against the ball. The clean sheets in the end all rely on them.

```{r}

Goalie <- filter(df, position == "Goalkeeper") %>% 
  select(c('full_name','clean_sheets_overall','position','current_club','age','birthday_gmt', 'appearances_overall' ))

GoalieClean <- Goalie[order(-Goalie$clean_sheets_overall),]

kable(GoalieClean, format = "html" , caption = "Top league Goalies",align = "cccccccccccccccc") %>% kable_styling()

```


## Winning Team

### League Rankings

This graph shows the winning team of the league and later on shows the goals they scored giving more context as to why they were
ranked this way.

```{r}
dfTeams %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= reorder(common_name,+league_position) ,y= league_position )) +
  geom_col() + theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90)) + labs(x = "Club Name",
                                                                    y = "League Position")
```

### League Ranking Stats

```{r}
dfWin <- filter(dfTeams) %>% select(c('common_name', 'league_position','performance_rank','goals_scored','goals_conceded',
                                     'goal_difference','matches_played', 'wins' , 'draws', 
                                     'losses', 'points_per_game'  )) 

winClean <- dfWin[order(dfWin$league_position),]

kable(winClean, format = "html" , caption = "Team Performance",align = "ccccccccccc") %>% kable_styling()
```

### Goal Difference by League Position

```{r}
dfTeams %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= league_position ,y= goal_difference, fill = common_name)) +
  geom_col()
```

### Goals Overall By League Position

```{r}
dfTeams %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x= league_position ,y= goals_scored, fill = common_name)) +
  geom_col()
```


## Who's Gonna Win?

This section is the most special to me and I think a very interesting part of statistics and football.
This is a machine learning program that in theory should be able to predict who should win a game. This is not necessarily 100 percent
accurate prediction but the main thing is to deter bookies from scamming odds.

```{r}

H_df<-dfMatches%>%select(-date_gmt, -away_team_name)%>%
      group_by(status, home_team_name)%>%arrange(game_week)%>%
      mutate_at(vars(home_team_goal_count:average_goals_per_match_pre_match), funs(lag))%>%
      na.omit()%>%
      mutate_at(vars(home_team_goal_count:average_goals_per_match_pre_match), funs(cummean))%>%
      select(-away_ppg)%>%ungroup()

colnames(H_df)<-paste("H", colnames(H_df), sep = "_")

A_df<-dfMatches%>%select(-date_gmt, -home_team_name)%>%
      group_by(status, away_team_name)%>%arrange(game_week)%>%
      mutate_at(vars(home_team_goal_count:average_goals_per_match_pre_match), funs(lag))%>%
      na.omit()%>%
      mutate_at(vars(home_team_goal_count:average_goals_per_match_pre_match), funs(cummean))%>%
      select(-home_ppg)%>%ungroup()

colnames(A_df)<-paste("A", colnames(A_df), sep = "_")

results_df <- dfMatches %>% select(game_week, status, home_team_name, away_team_name, home_team_goal_count, away_team_goal_count)

final_df <- results_df %>% inner_join(H_df, by=c("home_team_name"="H_home_team_name")) %>% inner_join(A_df, by=c("away_team_name"="A_away_team_name"))

h2o.init()

Train <- final_df%>%filter(game_week <= 38, game_week >= 3)

Test <- final_df%>%filter(game_week >= 20)

Train_h2o <- as.h2o(Train)

Test_h2o <- as.h2o(Test)


aml <- h2o.automl(y = 5,  x=6:62, training_frame = Train_h2o,   leaderboard_frame  = Test_h2o, max_runtime_secs = 60)

lb <- aml@leaderboard

pred <- h2o.predict(aml@leader, Test_h2o)

h2o.performance(model = aml@leader, newdata = Train_h2o)
```

## Am I A Good Player?

In this section there are 4 graphs that show a correlation between how many goals someone should score and how good they should be.

```{r,warning= FALSE, message=FALSE}
  
mod1 <- glm(data = df,
            formula = goals_overall ~ age + current_club + assists_overall + red_cards_overall + minutes_played_overall + clean_sheets_overall)

mod2 <- glm(data = df,
            formula = goals_overall ~ age * current_club * assists_overall * red_cards_overall * minutes_played_overall * clean_sheets_overall)

compare_performance(mod1,mod2) %>% plot()

add_predictions(df, mod2, type = "response") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=age, y= pred)) +
          geom_smooth() + labs(title = "Age")

add_predictions(df, mod2, type = "response") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=assists_overall, y = pred)) +
          geom_smooth() + labs(title = "Assists")

add_predictions(df, mod2, type = "response") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = minutes_played_overall, y = pred)) +
          geom_smooth() + labs(title = "Minutes Played")

add_predictions(df, mod2, type = "response") %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=clean_sheets_overall, y = pred)) +
          geom_smooth() + labs(title = "Clean Sheets")

```

## Takeaway

My take away from studying the data is that it can be really easy to talk about who is at the top of the league and who is scoring the most
just by reading a table but there is a lot more that the data does not flat out tell you. So my advice is if you want to talk to people about 
football just watch a bit and ask questions. There also is a lot of things that they do not collect for data but speak of more in passing like passes and time ball was controlled.
